# Hi, friends; thanks for visiting my profile!  

I am Reetesh, a techno-commercial professional with 20+ years of experience, split (almost) evenly between sales and delivery. I am originally from India but have lived in Singapore for over 17 years.

I have sold B2B and B2B2C SaaS and Enterprise Software services and solutions to global, regional, and local customers across many verticals, including BFSI, Public Sector, etc.

Iâ€™m currently working on incubating my own startup - **Seqest Solutions**. We:

- Develop software solutions and services in the areas of AI, BI, CX, and enterprise platforms.
  
- Resell platforms and solutions to customers in the Southeast Asia (SEA) market.

- Advise companies wanting to expand in the fast-growing SEA market.
